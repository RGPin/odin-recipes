    <h2>Steps: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 2-quart rectangular baking dish.</li>
        <li>Combine zucchini and salt in a large bowl and toss to coat evenly. Transfer zucchini to a colander set in the sink. Let stand to drain excess moisture, 15 minutes. Transfer zucchini to a clean kitchen towel and squeeze out any remaining liquid. Use paper towels to wipe the large bowl dry.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and cook until soft and translucent, about 4 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 minute more.</li>
        <li>Whisk together eggs and pepper in the large bowl. Add zucchini, onion mixture, mozzarella, Cheddar, and 1/2 cup of the Parmesan cheese; combine thoroughly. </li>
        <li>Transfer mixture to the prepared baking dish and spread into an even layer. </li>
        <li>Bake, uncovered, for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine panko and melted butter in a small bowl. Stir in remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Top casserole with breadcrumb mixture and bake until golden and crisp, 10 to 15 minutes. Garnish with chives.</li>
